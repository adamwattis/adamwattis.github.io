Complete rehaul of the Human Computer Interaction lab at Penn State. The lab needed a portfolio style website that would display the lab members, their publications and press releases about the lab. The lab members also needed to be able to edit all this information in a convenient way. The solution was a webapp, written with Nuxt.js, and a backend API.

The solution was designed so that it was streamlined to the labs purposes: the user interface allowed for simple editing of the information and the page only displayed relevant information in a purposefull manner.
